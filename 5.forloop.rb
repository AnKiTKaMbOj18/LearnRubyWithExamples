# Ruby for Loop -
# Ruby for loop iterates over a specific range of numbers.
# Hence, for loop is used if a program has fixed number of iterations.
# Ruby for loop will execute once for each element in expression.

# Exm 1-
# its similar to other languages for loop with some syntax diffrence , working is same

a = gets.chomp.to_i
for i in 1..a do
  puts i
end

# Exm 2 -
# Iterating over array using for loops

x = ["Blue", "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "White"]
for i in x do
  puts i
end

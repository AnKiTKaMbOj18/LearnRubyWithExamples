#while loop -
  #The Ruby while loop is used to iterate a program several times.
  #If the number of iterations is not fixed for a program, while loop is used.
  #Ruby while loop executes a condition while a condition is true.
  #Once the condition becomes false, while loop stops its execution.

# Ex-1
x = gets.chomp.to_i

while x >= 0
puts x
x -=1
end

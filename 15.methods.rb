#Ruby Methods
=begin
  Ruby methods prevent us from writing the same code in a program again and again.
  It is a set of expression that returns a value.
  Ruby methods are similar to the functions in other lnguages.
  They unite one or more repeatable statements into one single bundle.

#Defining Method
  To use a method, we need to first define it.
  Ruby method is defined with the def keyword followed by method name.
  At the end we need to use end keyword to denote that method has been defined.

def welcomeMethod()
  puts "welcome to my tutorials repo, hope docs are worth reading for you guys";
  puts "please let me know for suggestions , changes or for more information";
  puts "please follow for further updates or reach out to me at ak.ankitkamboj18@gmail.com"
end

welcomeMethod()

#Note - These methods are similar to methods in other languages i.e in java/javscript/c
        #with little syntax changes

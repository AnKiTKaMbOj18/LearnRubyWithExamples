#WHAT_IS_RUBY -
  # Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language.
  # Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages.
  # It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.
  # It is fully object oriented programming language.
  # Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions.
  # Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.
  # Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment).
  # It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.
